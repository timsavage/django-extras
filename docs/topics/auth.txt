==============================
User authentication extensions
==============================

.. module:: django_extras.contrib.auth
   :synopsis: Extensions to django.contrib.auth

While Django comes with a built in user authentication system it leaves a
couple of common use-cases incomplete. Django Extras fills in the missing
pieces.


Installation
============

No installation is required, this extension does not require additional
database models.

Convenience decorators
======================

.. currentmodule:: django_extras.contrib.auth.decorators

The staff_required decorator
----------------------------

.. function:: staff_required([include_superusers=True, login_url=None, raise_exception=False])

    This decorator provides a simple way to restrict access to a particular
    view to only users who have the *is_staff* set. Rather than using the
    `~django.contrib.auth.decorators.user_passes_test()` decorator
    restricting a view to staff only can be written as::

        from django_extras.contrib.auth.decorators import staff_required
        @staff_required
        def my_view(request):
            ...

    By default this decorator also includes users with the *is_superuser* flag
    set, these users can be excluded with the optional ``include_superuser``
    parameter. Example::

        from django_extras.contrib.auth.decorators import staff_required
        @staff_required(include_superusers=False)
        def my_view(request):
            ...

    As in the :func:`~decorators.login_required`, ``login_url`` defaults to
    :setting:`settings.LOGIN_URL <LOGIN_URL>`.

    Following from the change in Django 1.4 this decorator also includes the
    ``raise_exception`` parameter, If given, the decorator will raise
    :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied`.

The superuser_required decorator
--------------------------------

.. function:: superuser_required([login_url=None, raise_exception=False])

    This decorator provides a simple way to restrict access to a particular
    view to only users who have the *is_superuser* flag set. Rather than using
    the `~django.contrib.auth.decorators.user_passes_test()` decorator
    restricting a view to staff only can be written as::

        from django_extras.contrib.auth.decorators import superuser_required
        @superuser_required
        def my_view(request):
            ...

    As in the :func:`~decorators.login_required`, ``login_url`` defaults to
    :setting:`settings.LOGIN_URL <LOGIN_URL>`.

    Following from the change in Django 1.4 this decorator also includes the
    ``raise_exception`` parameter, If given, the decorator will raise
    :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied`.

Ownership Mixin Models
======================

.. currentmodule:: django_extras.contrib.auth.models

Two mixin classes are provided that provide a consistent API for assigning
ownership of a model instance to a user object.

Example::

    class MyModel(SingleOwnerMixin, models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

Both :class:`SingleOwnerMixin` and :class:`MultipleOwnerMixin` provide the
following methods.

Many methods include `include_staff` and `include_superuser` parameters, these
are used to treat staff and superuser users as if they are owners of the
instance.

.. class:: OwnerMixinBase

.. method:: OwnerMixinBase.owned_by(user, [include_staff=False, include_superuser=False])

    Returns a boolean value to indicate if the supplied user is a valid owner
    of model instance.

.. method:: OwnerMixinBase.owner_list()

    Returns a list of :class:`User` models that are owners of the model
    instance. A list is returned by both single and multiple versions of the
    mixin.

``SingleOwnerMixin``
--------------------

.. class:: SingleOwnerMixin

    This class provides a simple way to enable a single user to own a model
    instance.

    .. attribute:: owner

        ``User`` object as provided by a ``ForeignKey`` model field.

    .. note::

        By default the ``related_name`` parameter is set to:
        ``'%(app_label)s_%(class)s_owner'``

``MultipleOwnerMixin``
----------------------

.. class:: MultipleOwnerMixin

    This class provides a simple way to enable multiple users to own a model
    instance.

    .. attribute:: owners

        ``RelatedManager`` object as provided by a ``ManyToManyField`` model
        field.

    .. note::

        By default the ``related_name`` parameter is set to:
        ``'%(app_label)s_%(class)s_owners'``

``OwnerMixinManager``
---------------------

.. class:: OwnerMixinManager

    Manager class used by :class:`SingleOwnerMixin` and
    :class:`MultipleOwnerMixin` to simplify obtaining a list of all model
    instances owned by a particular user.

Fetching owned instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. method:: OwnerMixinManager.owned_by(user, [include_staff=False, include_superuser=False])

Returns a ``QuerySet`` filtered by the user or users. The user parameter can
be either a single :class:`User` object, a sequence of :class:`User` objects or
a single or sequence of user primary keys.

Example::

    # Single user
    >>> MyModel.objects.owned_by(request.user)
    [<MyModel: Foo>, <MyModel: Bar>]

    # Multiple primary keys
    >>> MyModel.objects.owned_by([1, 2, 3])
    [<MyModel: Foo>, <MyModel: Bar>, <MyModel: Eek>]

.. note::
    It is not possible to use the `include_staff` and `include_superuser`
    parameters along when passing a sequence for the `user` parameter. A
    :exe:`TypeError` exception will be raised in this case.


Shortcuts
=========

.. currentmodule:: django_extras.contrib.auth.shortcuts

.. function:: get_owned_object_or_40x([klass, owner, include_staff=False, include_superuser=False, *args, **kwargs])

A convenience method that follows on from the Django shortcut `get_object_or_404`.
If the object cannot be loaded an :class:`Http404` exception is raised if an
object is loaded but the owner is not valid a :class:`PermissionDenied`
exception is raised.

Is with the other extensions `include_staff` and `include_superuser` flags are
provided. `*args` and `**kwargs` work in the same way as `get_object_or_404`.
